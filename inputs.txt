I recently used a home cleaning service,
and I have mixed feelings about it. The team arrived on time, which I really appreciated,
and they were very polite. However, I was disappointed with the attention to detail.
Some areas were left dusty, and I had to clean them myself afterward. 
For the price I paid, I expected a more thorough job. On the bright side,
scheduling the service was easy, and customer support was responsive when I raised my concerns.
Overall, Iâ€™m not sure if I would use this service again.
